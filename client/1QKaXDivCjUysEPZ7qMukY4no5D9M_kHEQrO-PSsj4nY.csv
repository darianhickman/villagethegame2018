this spreadsheet stores finite state machine for the entire game. Let me know if you have questions about implementing this.
I also want to have a sheet of all possible events in the game and their triggers and effects so.  However fsm is heavily overlapping. So... ideal implementation is only events in events sheet could be entries in the FSM, go with warning instead of ban",working,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nLSXKITXWDNcyRzYyWv8P83f2lUWv4sqKBGzm3o7Ks0,is there a game state object already?
